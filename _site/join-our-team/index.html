<p>Dear Real Estate Agent:</p>

<p>Are you looking to make more money in your business and decrease your stress—and do both with less effort?</p>

<p>I understand that you want your business to grow, to feel as though you belong to something greater than yourself, and to be able to give back to others in your community (be that through educating your fellow agents or through charitable donations to important causes).</p>

<p><strong>But many agents like yourself may be facing certain barriers that prevent you from achieving the lifestyle that you want for you and your family.</strong> You might have the drive, passion, and desire to grow yourself and your business, but perhaps you lack the discipline or you don’t have a clear, concise direction to get there. It could also be that you simply don’t know which activities to participate in to launch yourself forward in your career.</p>

<p>The unpredictability of the business, in turn, may cause you to stay up late into the night worrying about where your next commission will come from. Some agents wind up feeling like frauds because they claim they know the path to success, but fail to follow it themselves. If they did know what to do, wouldn’t they be doing it?</p>

<p>Real estate can be a difficult business for those who lack the proper resources, after all. <strong>Did you know that 87% of real estate agents fail in their first year in the business?</strong> </p>

<p>So what’s the solution? Many don’t even know, so they hope that by clinging to someone with more financial success, they’ll eventually learn their secrets through osmosis. Others might simply plug on, doing the same thing and waiting to find a “magic pill”—some windfall of perfect timing and good luck that will somehow fix their lack of forward motion in the industry. </p>

<p>Still others might just move onto another brokerage and hope for the best. Tell me this: Which brokerage has the evidence to suggest that they’re the best opportunity to create the most money in the shortest amount of time with the least effort? I challenge you to ask your current broker which of those opportunities they can provide to you.</p>

<p>What will happen if these problems go unsolved? Many will continue to do the same things and simply hope for a different result, riding the feast/famine roller coaster on which success and stability aren’t a guarantee.</p>

<p><strong>My name is Rob Talbot and I believe that I have the solution to your pain: I’m offering you a chance to join our team.</strong></p>

<p>See, I care about the people I’m in business with to the point that I don’t just allow anyone to work with us. If they don’t see the value in it, I’ll respect that about them. I want people who are willing to be a part of the process and who care enough to contribute to our mutual success. You won’t be treated like you’re just a number.</p>

<p><strong>By joining our team, you stand to gain:</strong>
<ul class="indent">
<li>Access to models and systems that identify the activities necessary to help you reach your goals</li>
<li>The tools, technology, and training that give you the skills needed to make the most of those activities</li>
<li>A support staff and leadership team that guide and support you during your journey</li>
<li>Access to models systems that will help you invest your money wisely in order to help you build wealth over time</li>
</ul></p>

<p>But you don’t have to take my word for it: the success stories of our current and former employees speak for themselves.</p>

<p>Around 10 years ago, an agent came to our team. She was a single mom who broke into the real estate business because her family was full of doctors, engineers, and other financially successful people. She didn’t have a degree herself, and so for her, getting her real estate license was a means to making what a professional would make without that degree.</p>

<p>By her fourth year, she was the No.1 agent in our office. By her fifth year, she was the No. 1 agent in our region. In her sixth year, she grew her team so much that she was able to free up her time, which allowed her to invest in and own other KW franchises and spend more time with her family. Now after 10 years, she owns at least a piece of five different real estate franchises and has a production team that allows her to stay out of day-to-day activities.</p>

<p>Another favorite story of mine is that of an agent who previously worked as a teacher at a local prison outside of town. He was not satisfied with his career at all. He got his real estate license so that he’d be able to make enough to stop teaching. He probably would have been fine making $40,000 to $50,000 a year. </p>

<p>However, this agent had a highly analytical personality, and frankly, he was the least charismatic person you could think of. He had his real estate license for two years working with a certain nameless company whose agents wear gold jackets. In that time, he sold zero homes—that’s right, zero—even after all the trainings, classes, and mentorship programs he’d gone through.</p>

<p>A friend of mine heard a rumor that the office this agent worked for was going to let some of their agents who hadn’t sold anything in the last year go in order to keep their E&amp;O costs low. The agent in question was on that list of agents who would be giving back their licenses. </p>

<p>My friend introduced the agent to me, and I quickly got him into our program. I told him that I could teach him how to sell a house and how to make money, but I couldn’t teach him how to want it. As it turns out, I didn’t need to. He initially set a modest business plan to make $75,000 a year (I talked him up from his earlier plan to make only $50,000). But in his first year with our company, he made $72,000! In his second year, he quit his job as a teacher at the prison. In his third year, he was rated the No. 1 individual producer for the offer, and he ended up ranking among the top-10 individual agents of that year. More recently in 2018, he was able to fully retire and move to San Diego. If this boring, uncharismatic man could do it, why couldn’t you?</p>

<p>Here’s my offer: <strong>Let’s meet and have a conversation so that, together, we can figure out what resources you’ll need in order to succeed with us.</strong> Here, you’ll integrate to an environment that will truly transform your life, complete with the coaching, consulting, education with the industry’s greatest tools, systems, models, and leadership that will allow you to contribute your time, talent, and resources to our community.</p>

<p>If you choose to accept the offer, then your first step will be to commit to the program and make sure that this is really what you want for yourself. Following that, you’ll begin the process of developing skills, habits, and activities that place you firmly on the path toward success and wealth.</p>

<p><strong>I guarantee that if you follow my proven strategy, it will work for you.</strong> I’m so confident in my guarantee that if, for whatever reason, you commit to the process and it doesn’t produce results, I’ll refund your expenses.</p>

<p>So what are you waiting for? The world of real estate is changing, and there are many disruptors in the field. If you don’t change your course quickly, you’ll probably get left behind. Let’s see if I’m the right person to help you get your business to the next level.</p>

<p>I look forward to speaking with you soon!</p>

<p>Rob Talbot</p>
