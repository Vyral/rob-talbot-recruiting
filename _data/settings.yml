  about_markdown: |
    I am an accomplished real estate professional with many years of working with buyers and sellers. This is more than a business to meâ€¦ it is my mission to help my clients make educated decisions as they make one of the biggest investments of their lives. When you get ready to sell, I will provide a full market analysis allowing you to maximize the potential of your return, provide professional advice for staging your home and a marketing package that will assure you the information on your property is reaching the masses. I have lived in the Antelope Valley since 1984 and have been a successful business owner since 2003. In addition, I have been a recognized leader and innovator within community and charitable organizations, aggressive amongst competition and assertive while obtaining goals. I believe you will find me to be detail oriented, goal driven and dedicated to the continuation of personal and professional excellence in the Real Estate business.
